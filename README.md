Software development kit for Thread and Zigbee
A complete solution for building Thread 1.1 and Zigbee 3.0-certified products. The nRF52840 SoC and the nRF5 SDK for Thread and Zigbee together offer a powerful solution for battery powered IoT devices. The SDK also has limited support for the nRF52811 SoC.

nRF5 SDK for Thread and Zigbee takes a full advantage of the multiprotocol capabilities of the nRF52840 SoC by supporting concurrent Thread/Zigbee 3.0 and BluetoothÂ® Low Energy operation.
