This release is the production-ready release of the Thread features available on the nRF52840 chip.
The nRF52840 running the OpenThread stack is Thread 1.1 Certified (https://www.threadgroup.org/What-is-Thread#certifiedproducts).

This release is the production-ready release of the Zigbee features available on the nRF52840 chip.
The nRF52840 running the Zigbee stack conforms to Zigbee PRO R21 + Green Power Proxy specifications.

The Zigbee stack provided by the release has been successfully tested in Zigbee Alliance Authorized Test Laboratory
and has received formal approval from Zigbee Alliance as a Zigbee Compliant Platform.

The Nordic Zigbee software solution released as part of nRF5 SDK for Thread and Zigbee incorporates
the Base Device Behavior specification and the latest of the ZCL specification (ver. 7).
This enables to build, certify, and ship commercial Zigbee 3.0 Certified Products.

Software components and application examples for MDK, peripherals, BLE, and NFC
have been inherited from nRF5 SDK v15.3.0. No changes were made to the SDK v15.3.0 content.

For information about the supported toolchains, SoftDevices and boards, see the Getting Started with Thread and Zigbee page.

****** Multiprotocol limitations ******
- Interrupts with IRQ priority 2 and 3 must not be used for multiprotocol examples.
- Limitations of simultaneous operation of the SoftDevice frontend and the 802.15.4 frontend:
 - Do not use the PPI channels reserved by the SoftDevice (17, 18, 19).
 - The SoftDevice and the 802.15.4 driver must use separate sets of PPI channels, for example (1, 2) and (3, 4).
 - The SoftDevice and the 802.15.4 driver must use separate sets of GPIOTE channels, for example 4 and (6, 7).
- Due to a limitation of the SoftDevice, depending on the configured timeslot timeout of nRF IEEE 802.15.4 radio driver, BLE activity may cause 100% CPU utilization, or increase switching times. The details are presented in the official documentation in the Multiprotocol considerations section, available in Thread and Zigbee shared features > Multiprotocol support with BLE/Bluetooth > Dynamic multiprotocol.

---------------------------------------

****** Thread and Zigbee common features ******
- Introduced a new configuration parameter of NRF_LOG module: NRF_LOG_NON_DEFFERED_CRITICAL_REGION_ENABLED.
  When this parameter is enabled, NRF_LOG_FLUSH is called from critical section when non deffered mode is used.
- Added implementation of mbedtls mutexes for FreeRTOS.
- Added an option to use the MA-L block (Nordic Semiconductor's f4-ce-36) to derive the EUI64 address.
- Introduced a new API for resetting the DFU progress in the settings structure ("nrf_dfu_settings_progress_reset").


****** Thread ******
The Thread examples in this SDK are built on top of the OpenThread stack: https://github.com/openthread/openthread.

For information about the certification, see the OpenThread certification page in the Thread section.

*** New features
****************
- Introduced a set of new thread-safe libraries with concurrent access to cryptographic functions for RTOS environments.

*** Changes
***********
- Thread FreeRTOS examples now by default use the mbedTLS thread-safe libraries without hardware acceleration.
- Modified nRF52840 THCI scripts to correctly detect mesh-local prefix.
- Replaced the build_gcc_libs.bat file with build_gcc_libs.py. The .bat file was present in version 2.0.0, but was missing in version 3.0.0.
- Fixed potential assertions in ble_thread_swi_mtd_coap_cli and MQTT-SN examples.
- Fixed background DFU state machine lock-up. The problem was visible when Thread IPv6 interface was turned off and then turned on in the middle of the DFU process.
- Thread Benchmark application does not autostart Thread network by default anymore.
- Thread devices now use the MA-L (OUI) block (Nordic Semiconductor's f4-ce-36) to derive the EUI64 address for commissioning purposes.
- SPI interrupt PIN for the NCP and RCP Nordic OpenThread Border Router has been changed from 25 to 21 on the Raspberry Pi side.

*** Limitations
***************
- Thread initialization must be done outside of the FreeRTOS thread, that is before the FreeRTOS thread is created.
- The Thread FreeRTOS examples with libmedcrypto-threadsafe are not delivered for Keil compiler.

*** Known issues
****************
- Nordic OpenThread Border Router occasionally fails to initialize the access point service. Currently, a reboot is required in such situations.
- Nordic OpenThread Border Router using SPI polling configuration is not stable, it is advised to use the SPI with the INT pin configured.
- To use Ethernet connection on Nordic OpenThread Border Router, the Ethernet cable must be plugged in prior to boot.
- Re-initialization of the OpenThread stack and platform can be done only for single PHY configuration. For multiprotocol configuration, the full reset of the MCU is needed.
- External commissioning example with the RCP connected to the Nordic OpenThread Border Router does not work. The current workaround is to use the NCP instead.
- In mbedTLS thread-safe variant of libraries non-reentrant heap is used for mbedTLS. Reentrant version of calloc and free should be provided using mbedtls_platform_set_calloc_free() right after a call to otInstanceInitSingle().

****** Zigbee ******
This is a production-ready release of the Zigbee features available on the nRF52840 chip.

*** New features
****************
- Added an option to use a custom or the default MA-L block (Nordic Semiconductor's f4-ce-36) to derive the EUI64 address.
-- Note: The previous versions of SDK used an unofficial OUI. This OUI should not have been used in end products. This means that an example built with the current version of the SDK will render a device with a different EUI64 than an example built with the previous version of the SDK. In case of an OTA upgrade, this might require a factory reset and recommissioning of the device.
- Introduced Zigbee stack add-ons and moved the relevant parts of examples into add-ons.
- Added reset command to the Zigbee CLI.

*** Changes
***********
- Fixed an issue in Benchmark example related to a degradation in Keil performance. CPU utilization is higher (2x), network throughput is lower (/2).
- Fixed an issue with the OTA server not responding with Default Response if Image Block Request for non-existing image is sent. It answers with Image Block Response with status ABORT (0x95) instead.
- Fixed an issue with the OTA client not accepting upgrade image unless Stack Release version is the same as in current image.
- Fixed an issue with the NVRAM APS binding table dataset format. A device using the SDK v2.0.0 or older can now be safely upgraded to the SDK v3.1.0. For migration from the SDK v3.0.0 to the SDK v3.1.0, see the Known issues section below.
- Fixed an issue with reading GLOBAL_CLUSTER_REVISION (0xfffd) attribute on the clusters that does not have attributes list. Read Attributes Response command will contain UNSUPPORTED_ATTRIBUTE status for such type of clusters. Possible workaround: declare empty attribute list for this cluster and pass it into the cluster list declaration (instead of 0-NULL declaration):
    #define ZB_ZCL_DECLARE_EMPTY_ATTRIB_LIST(attr_list)  \ 
            ZB_ZCL_START_DECLARE_ATTRIB_LIST(attr_list)  \
            ZB_ZCL_FINISH_DECLARE_ATTRIB_LIST
- Fixed an issue with a retransmission of Query Next Image Response that would restart the DFU image download process.            

            
*** Limitations
***************
- Dynamic Memory Configuration: Binding table entries number with unique source address, endpoint, and cluster id is limited to 32.
- ZB KERNEL: Zigbee performance might be affected by heavy flash operations. Zigbee stack subsystem periodically runs migration process. As flash operations block the CPU, this may affect Zigbee time-critical processes (Association, Rejoin, Leave, GreenPower Commissioning etc.) if it occurs at the same time with such processes. The likelihood of this is low, but may occur if Parent device is joining 20+ devices one-by-one without delays, or in other cases of mass NVRAM operations in intersection with mass radio operations. This issue does not affect steady state operation.
- It is not advised to change values of parameters defined in memory configuration feature between firmwares, while performing OTA firmware upgrade.

*** Known issues
****************
- Multiprotocol: Match Descriptor Response message might not be propagated to the application layer.
- OTA DFU: In case of MCU reset between completion of OTA image transfer and postponed firmware upgrade, the upgrade will be applied immediately.
- For a device that upgrades from the SDK v3.0.0 (66th version of ZBOSS) to the SDK v3.1.0 (67th-bis version of ZBOSS), the migration may randomly fail, leading to a corrupted binding table that requires a factory reset of the device if the relation between the number of source/destination binding table entries equals:
-- for end devices: src = 37 - 2 * dst
-- for routers/coordinator: src = 73 - 2 * dst

*** Compatible tools
********************

- Multi-sensor example, which demonstrates how to create a custom Zigbee cluster.
- Multi-sensor FreeRTOS example, which demonstrates how to use the Zigbee stack with RTOS.
- Zigbee CLI wrapper example and Python library.

*** Changes
***********
- Updated Zigbee stack pre-built libraries.
- Added support for Finding and Binding procedure to light control example.
- Added support for WS2812 shield to light control example.
- Extended BLE UART and Zigbee Light Switch Example to allow for controlling Color Control Cluster and multiple endpoints.
- Updated Coordinator in Light Control example. It can now open network on the BSP_BUTTON_0 button press.
- Extended Zigbee CLI Agent Router example with new commands.
- Moved OTA client example from experimental to production.
- Removed production config generator tool (replaced by nrfutil).

*** Limitations
***************
- Dynamic Memory Config: Binding table entries number with unique source address, endpoint, and cluster ID is limited to 32.

*** Known issues
****************
- Benchmark example: Degradation in Keil performance. CPU utilization is higher (2x), network throughput is lower (/2).
- Multiprotocol: Match Descriptor Response message might not be propagated to the application layer.
- ZB KERNEL: Zigbee performance might be affected by heavy flash operations. Zigbee stack subsystem periodically runs migration process. As flash operations block the CPU this may affect Zigbee time-critical processes (Association, Rejoin, Leave, GreenPower Commissioing etc.)
                           if it occurs at the same time with such processes. The likelihood of this is low, but may occur if Parent device is joining 20+ devices one-by-one without delays, or in other cases of mass NVRAM operations in intersection with mass radio operations.
                           This issue does not affect steady state operation.
- OTA DFU: In case of MCU reset between completion of OTA image transfer and postponed firmware upgrade, the upgrade will be applied immediately.
- OTA DFU: It is impossible to cancel OTA upgrade by sending Default Response with code ABORT in response to OTA Upgrade End Request sent by the client.
- OTA DFU: OTA server does not respond with Default Response if Image Block Request for non-existing image is sent. Instead, it answers with Image Block Response with status ABORT (0x95).
- OTA DFU: OTA client will not accept upgrade image unless Stack Release version is the same as in current image. 
- OTA DFU: NVRAM APS binding table dataset format has been changed between SDK 2.0.0 and SDK 3.0.0. For a device that uses bindings, this means that if it will be updated from the SDK 2.0.0 or older to SDK 3.0.0 or newer, all bindings will be lost and a device will stop functioning.
                         Moreover, it is unsafe to update a device in that case due to possible memory corruption. Reset to factory defaults and re-commissioning are needed. For a device that does not use bindings,
                         it is safe to update from the to SDK 3.0.0 or newer.
- ZCL: There is an issue with reading GLOBAL_CLUSTER_REVISION (0xfffd) attribute on the clusters that do not have list of attributes. Read Attributes Response command will
                     contain UNSUPPORTED_ATTRIBUTE status for such type of clusters. Possible workaround: declare empty attribute list for this cluster and pass it into the cluster list
                     declaration (instead of 0-NULL declaration):
                     #define ZB_ZCL_DECLARE_EMPTY_ATTRIB_LIST(attr_list)  \  
                             ZB_ZCL_START_DECLARE_ATTRIB_LIST(attr_list)  \
                             ZB_ZCL_FINISH_DECLARE_ATTRIB_LIST

nRF5 SDK for Thread and Zigbee v2.0.0
---------------------------
Release Date: Week 39, 2018

This release is the production-ready release of the Thread features available on the nRF52840 chip.
The nRF52840 running the OpenThread stack is Thread 1.1 Certified (https://www.threadgroup.org/What-is-Thread#certifiedproducts).

This release is the production-ready release of the Zigbee features available on the nRF52840 chip.
The nRF52840 running the Zigbee stack conforms to Zigbee PRO R21 + Green Power Proxy specifications. The Zigbee stack provided by the release has been successfully tested in Zigbee Alliance Authorized Test Laboratory and has received formal approval from Zigbee Alliance as a Zigbee Compliant Platform.
The Nordic Zigbee software solution released as part of nRF5 SDK for Thread and Zigbee incorporates the Base Device Behavior
specification and the latest of the ZCL specification (ver. 7). This enables to build, certify, and ship commercial Zigbee 3.0 Certified Products.

Software components and application examples for MDK, peripherals, BLE, and NFC
have been inherited from nRF5 SDK v15.2.0. Minor changes to the SDK v15.2.0 are
summarized in the following section.

*** Changes to nRF5 SDK v15.2.0
********************************

- Introduced a new option FDS_VIRTUAL_PAGES_RESERVED to the FDS module to prevent overwriting of persistent data.
- Modified nrf_drv_power driver to prevent double initialization.
- Fixes in the background DFU module.

****** Multiprotocol limitations ******
- Interrupts with IRQ priority 2 and 3 must not be used for multiprotocol examples.
- Limitations of simultaneous operation of the SoftDevice frontend and the 802.15.4 frontend:
	- Do not use the PPI channels reserved by the SoftDevice (17, 18, 19).
	- The SoftDevice and the 802.15.4 driver must use separate sets of PPI channels, for example (1, 2) and (3, 4).
	- The SoftDevice and the 802.15.4 driver must use separate sets of GPIOTE channels, for example 4 and (6, 7).

****** Thread ******

The Thread examples in this SDK are built on top of the OpenThread stack: https://github.com/openthread/openthread.

*** New features
*****************

- Added new examples presenting multiprotocol BLE Scanner and Thread Sleepy End Devices.
- Added new features to the benchmark example: BLE connection and data exchange, and 802.15.4 CSL wake-up sequence simulator.
- Added a new PCA10059 (nRF52840 USB dongle) variant to CLI and NCP examples.

*** Changes
*****************

- Updated pre-built OpenThread libraries for all supported toolchains.
- Updated the Thread Border Router project based on OpenThread's border router project to support the updated OpenThread libraries.
- Updated nRF Thread Topology Monitor with new features, such as:
   - Improved management of serial port, for example adding support for PCA10059.
   - Added indication about number of nodes in the network and TTM node.
   - Added more options for polling time.

*** Limitations
*****************
- Thread initialization must be done outside of the FreeRTOS thread, that is before the FreeRTOS thread is created.

*** Known issues:
*****************
- Nordic OpenThread Border Router occasionally fails to initialize the access point service. Currently,
  a reboot is required in such situations.
- In order to use Ethernet connection on Nordic OpenThread Border Router, the Ethernet cable must be plugged in prior to boot.
- Download and Debug procedure fails under IAR Embedded Workbench with Thread/BLE Dynamic MTD CoAP Client and
  Bluetooth Low Energy Nordic UART Service (NUS) example. To resolve this issue, flash the firmware using nrfjprog directly,
  or proceed as follows:
    - Right-click the project name -> Options -> Linker -> Output -> uncheck "Include debug information in output".
    - Make the project (F7) and repeat the Download and Debug procedure.

*** Compatible tools:
*****************
- nrfutil-4.0.0 (available from https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfutil)
- nRF Thread Topology Monitor (nRF TTM) v0.12.0-1.alpha
- RaspPi_OT_Border_Router_Demo_v2.0.0-1.alpha.img

These tools are available from https://www.nordicsemi.com/thread#Downloads and https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/nRF-Thread-Topology-monitor#Downloads

The following OpenThread commit has been used to generate pre-built Thread stack libraries, and for testing and verification:
- https://github.com/openthread/openthread/tree/704511c (with revert of 136a444)

The following nRF IEEE 802.15.4 radio driver has been included in pre-built Thread stack libraries, and used for testing
and verification:
- https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/tree/68a54db (v1.2.1)

The following wpantund and Border Router commits have been used as part of the
Nordic OpenThread Border Router solution, and for testing and verification:
-	https://github.com/openthread/wpantund/tree/2635e667202577499e04880ed450aae425c72ead
-	https://github.com/openthread/borderrouter/tree/3fd00c00f75c9e7e52f8ced54ddfc7b5fb398b6b

*** Certification
*****************

The OpenThread stack has been officially certified on nRF52840 as Thread Group Certified Component.

The included stack was internally tested using Thread V1.1 Test Harness 1.3.2 R48 and the complete Thread Test Bed.

The DUT device has been tested in the following combinations:

- PCA10056 v1.0.0 - GCC libraries
- PCA10056 v1.0.0 - IAR libraries

All 150 out of 150 tests passed.

The test Router_9_2_10 occasionally fails due to the incorrect test case definition in Thread V1.1 Test Harness 1.3.2 software.
In step 7, the test case checks if unicast MLE Data Response sent to SED includes non-stable data. This problem is being processed
by Thread Group: https://threadgroup.atlassian.net/browse/TSTBED-96. As a workaround, the incorrect step was removed as suggested.

Due to Thread Harness issue and non-compliant implementation of Golden Devices in the Thread Test Bed,
several certification tests fail (https://threadgroup.atlassian.net/browse/TESTPLAN-380) with the default topology config file.
For seven test cases, 5.6.4, 5.6.6, 5.6.9, 7.1.3, 7.1.5, 9.2.6, 9.2.18, an OpenThread device is used as a SED Golden Device.
The modified topology config is available in the release zip. Thread Authorized Test Laboratories
also use OpenThread devices as SED devices in those test cases. The modified topology configuration is available
in the directory \external\openthread\thread_harness\config. This modification is acceptable by Thread Authorized Test
Laboratories until Thread Harness and Golden Device vendors fix the non-compliance issue.

*** Certification
*****************

The OpenThread stack has been officially certified on nRF52840 as Thread Group Certified Component.

The included stack was internally tested using Thread V1.1 Test Harness 1.3.0 R48 and the complete Thread Test Bed.

The DUT device has been tested in the following combinations:

- PCA10056 v0.11.0 and PCA10056 v0.9.0 - GCC libraries
- PCA10056 v0.11.0 - IAR libraries

All 150 out of 150 tests passed.

The test Router_9_2_10 occasionally fails due to the incorrect test case definition in Thread V1.1 Test Harness 1.3.0 software.
In step 7, the test case checks if unicast MLE Data Response sent to SED includes non-stable data.

  - an example of a Zigbee Router, acting as a Zigbee dimmable light bulb and Eddystone beacon at the same time.
  - an example of a Zigbee End Device, acting as a light switch and Bluetooth Low Energy Nordic UART Service (NUS) at the same time.
    A variant of this example with support for touchlink Initiator role is also provided.

The following commit of nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver has been used for
building the Zigbee stack radio driver:
- https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nRF-IEEE-802.15.4-radio-driver/commit/d6fc602 (v1.1.0)

Limitations:
- The provided examples are not power, speed, and size optimized.
- Touchlink support is not certification compliant and has the following limitations:
   - The current Zigbee stack is not resilient to sending out of order commands during touchlink commissioning.
   - Zigbee End Device can be a touchlink Initiator, but not a target.
   - The user callback for the touchlink identify request is not implemented.
   - There is no application signal between Scan Response and Network Start/Network Join Router. This also means that neither
     touchlink identify request nor reset to factory defaults can be sent during the commissioning process.
   - It is impossible to commission the target if it was already commissioned and put into factory default state afterwards.
     The Initiator remembers which devices are included in the network and ignores target responses.
   - It is impossible for the touchlink Initiator to commission devices if the device has joined a centralized network.
   - The touchlink target does not send direct join requests.
- Interrupts with IRQ priority 2 and 3 should not be used for multiprotocol Zigbee/Bluetooth LE examples.
- Zigbee Sleepy End Device role is not supported.
